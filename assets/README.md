This folder is intended to hold images and other static assets for the website.

Place your profile photo at `assets/images/profile.jpg` and project screenshots in `assets/images/`.

Currently the pages use placeholder images (via https://placehold.co). Replace the `src` attributes
in the HTML files with local paths (for example `assets/images/profile.jpg`) once you add your images.
